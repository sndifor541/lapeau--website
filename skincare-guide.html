    <h2>Skincare Routine Guide</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Cleanse</h3>
            <p>
                Start your skincare routine by removing dirt, oil, and impurities with a gentle cleanser. Use lukewarm water and massage the product into your skin in circular motions. This preps your face and creates a clean base for the rest of your products. For dry skin, go for a hydrating formula. For oily or acne-prone skin, try a gel or foam-based vegan cleanser.

            <h3>Step 2: Exfoliate</h3>
            <p>
                Exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells and promotes cell turnover. Use a vegan exfoliator with natural beads or gentle fruit enzymes 1–2 times a week. Avoid harsh scrubs that can irritate your skin. Regular exfoliation can help your skin appear smoother, brighter, and more even in tone.

            <h3>Step 3: Toner</h3>
            <p>
                A toner helps to balance your skin’s pH and remove any leftover residue after cleansing. Use a gentle, alcohol-free vegan toner with soothing ingredients like rose water, chamomile, or witch hazel. Apply it with a cotton pad or pat it directly into your skin using your hands.

            <h3>Step 4: Serum</h3>
            <p>
                Serums contain high concentrations of active ingredients that target specific skin concerns like dullness, fine lines, or acne. For hydration, look for a hyaluronic acid serum. For brightening, choose one with Vitamin C. Apply a few drops and gently press the serum into your skin until fully absorbed.

            <h3>Step 5: Moisturizer</h3>
            <p>
                Lock in hydration with a moisturizer suited to your skin type. Vegan moisturizers often contain nourishing ingredients like shea butter, jojoba oil, or squalane. This step helps to strengthen your skin barrier and keep your skin soft and supple throughout the day or night.

            <h3>Step 6: SPF (Morning Only)</h3>
            <p>
                Sun protection is essential to prevent premature aging, sunburn, and skin cancer. Use a broad-spectrum vegan sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every morning—even on cloudy days. Apply as the final step in your daytime routine and reapply every two hours when exposed to the sun.
